        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The Italian tube-shaped pasta called cannelloni, which is also known as manicotti in the United States, is essentially a sheet of pasta (or a crespella, the Italian equivalent of a crepe) rolled into a tube. Cannelloni, Italian for "large reeds," was invented sometime during the early 1900s. It is typically stuffed, topped with a sauce, and baked.</p>
